		<h1>lived experiences project: my road to becoming a doctor</h1>
		<p>“You never realize how much you miss someone until they’re gone.”  This quote is so true for me.  On June 19, 2009, my grandfather lost his battle with Parkinson’s disease.  He was diagnosed in early 2008 and he was given a few years, at best, to live.  This hit my mom pretty hard.  My grandpa and her had a pretty special relationship.  Though he lived seven hours away, she always felt so close to him.  We would always make at least five trips per year to go and visit him.  My only regret is that I wish I ‘d gone to visit him more than we did.  I’ll never forget when my grandpa was a State Representative for Michigan and he would always make a special point to stop and visit us on his way to Lansing from the Upper Peninsula where he lived.  To give a brief overview of this disease, it is a disorder that attacks one’s central nervous system and, in turn, affects the fine motor skills.  Ever since his diagnosis with the disease, I have been researching extensively on the topic.  It all started when I came across the website www.webmd.com. It really bothered me that there wasn’t a cure for this disease in today’s world. Over the next few years, I started thinking about my career options and I undoubtedly decided to become a doctor.  I found it fascinating that a simple piece of technology such as a website could have such a powerful impact on my career plans.</p>
		<p>When I was thinking about what I wanted to do with my life, I knew that no matter what I did, I wanted to help people.  Helping others gives me the greatest feeling.  When my grandfather died, I lost my best friend.  I really didn’t know what I was going to do without him in my life.  Then I thought to myself, my grandfather wouldn’t want me wallowing in my own self-pity.  He would want me to continue living my life to its fullest.  So I chose to pursue a degree Kinesiology/Pre-Med.  This includes a Bachelors of Science degree in Kinesiology.  Upon acceptance into medical school, I will endure four more years of school, where I will be exposed to every facet of medicine.  After completion of medical school, I am required to complete a fellowship program, which is approximately three additional years.  I know it’s going to be a long road to success, but my grandpa always taught me that there is nothing I can’t do if I just believe in myself.  My grandpa always stressed to me that I should always strive to reach my full potential in life.  That’s why he started a college fund for my brother and I when we were young.  He didn’t want us to be another statistic in the world. He wanted us to make a difference in the world.  That is exactly what I intend to do.  One piece of technology that has been very instrumental in my career choice process was my computer.  With my computer, I can research and find answers to questions at much faster rates than using books.  I find myself using the website www.webmd.com every day for some reason or another.  I’ve always been fascinated with the human body, especially the brain and the nervous system since I learned that my grandfather had Parkinson’s disease.  I use this website to answer many of the questions racing through my mind throughout the day.  I always have my computer with me in case a topic of interest pops into my head.  There were other small factors that helped me decide on my career path, but I honestly believe that if I hadn’t used that website and my computer so much, I wouldn’t be on the path to becoming a doctor.</p>
		<p>The real turning point for me deciding on my career choice was when I found out that my grandfather was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. I have always had a passion for helping others, which is why I’m in the military, but this made me want to make a career out of helping people.  I couldn’t think of a better way to do that then to become a doctor.  When my grandfather died, I didn’t fully understand the science behind his disease.  Upon further research, I discovered that it is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that affects the fine motor skills in a person. The wonderful thing about my computer and the website www.webmd.com is that I can look up almost anything that has to do with medicine and I will be provide with an abundance of information. The real driving point around me becoming a doctor is helping people, but more importantly finding a cure for this less-than-enjoyable disease.  I can’t put into words how helpless I felt watching my grandpa deteriorate before my eyes the year before his death.  It was the most pain I have ever felt in my entire life.  I was younger at the time, but I was old enough to understand that my grandpa was going to die and there was nothing anyone could do.  I wish I could go back in time and make everything okay, but I can’t.  One thing I can do is become a doctor and try to find a cure for the disease that took his life and make sure that no one loses a loved one to this disease again.  I may not find a cure for Parkinson’s disease in my lifetime.  I may not even come close to finding a cure, but I will have devoted my life to finding the cure for the disease that took my grandfather’s life.  I don’t think my grandfather could be any more proud of me as long as I give everything I do in my life my best effort.  In the end, that’s all he asked of me. I miss you, grandpa.  I’ll never forget you and what you’ve taught me.</p>
