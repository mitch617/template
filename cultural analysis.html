			<h1>Cultural Analysis of The Social Network</h1>
			<p>Executive Summary</P
<p>Cliques, unique ideologies, and social class a very significant role in today’s world.  The movie “The Social Network” is a perfect example of this.  For example, Mark Zuckerberg is very condescending to his girlfriend at the time because she went to Boston University and Mark went to Harvard University, which is thought of to be one of the most prestigious universities in the United States.  That can suggest a few things.  For one, it can suggest that women are not as smart as men and therefor have less of a chance of getting accepted into Harvard University.  It also suggests that those who attend Harvard University are superior to those attend other universities.  A good example of this is when Mark implies that his girlfriend wouldn’t have the privilege of meeting some people because of where she attends college.  A very ironic point of the movie is that Mark Zuckerberg revolutionized the way people communicate with each other, and yet he can’t seem to communicate with himself.  One of Mark’s former friends and co-founder’s of Facebook, Eduardo Saverin, was not pleased at all with Mark’s decision to have Sean Parker join the team to further develop Facebook.  Eduardo wasn’t impressed by Sean at all, who, by the way, invented the music sharing website Napster.com.  It could be argued that Eduardo was power hungry ever since Mark dubbed him Facebook’s CFO.  When Mark was going on drunken rants and accidentally inventing Facesmash, as it was called at the time, Eduardo was very hesitant in getting involved.  Deep down, Eduardo saw Sean as a threat because Sean “knew” people.  Eduardo was in charge of getting investors for Facebook, but he was coming up short.  Sean had so many connections out in Palo Alto, California.  I think that this movie represents a true replication of today’s world especially in school settings.  Cliques and social class seem to dictate the way people can live their lives.  A simple solution to the recurring problems in this movie is not letting ego’s get in the way of success.  Throughout the rest of the movie, there are struggles for control, clashes of cliques, social class discrimination.
